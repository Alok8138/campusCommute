              **Campus Commute** was founded by a team of dedicated students and
              university staff who recognized the growing need for a modernized,
              efficient, and user-friendly transportation system. Frustrated by
              outdated schedules and fragmented information, we envisioned a
              platform that would centralize all transportation needs for the
              campus.

              From our initial brainstorming sessions to the launch of our
              digital bus pass system, every step has been driven by the desire
              to make campus life easier and more accessible for everyone. We
              continuously evolve, incorporating feedback and new technologies
              to serve you better.
